Here you will find abstracts as well as deeper exploration of two Big Ideas. Figure .: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Pet Wellness Sensor This innovative product brings advances being made in predictive and personalized healthcare to our pets at home. By applying a sensor to the neck of a dog or cat and a reader to the collar, various health measures can be tracked, with an initial use case for diabetic animals whose blood sugar would be continually recorded and analyzed. Impact Analyzer Using a crawling tool to scrape information from Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, large financial institutions can estimate a market size for impact-focused investment products before the products are built. The web crawling tool will output a database of individuals without a target demographic who are likely to invest (based on age, job titles and salary estimates), and cross reference that with available published interested on social media platforms. About the author Danielle Salah is currently pursuing a Masters of Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley’s School of Information. Previously, she held data management roles in the impact investing industry where she aimed to use data to inform investment decisions to maximize environmental and social impact. Before that, she received an MBA in Sustainable Management from Presidio Graduate School and a BS in Environmental Engineering from the University of Southern California. Updated: 2017-12-01 "],

While these advances are spectacular and necessary, a different subset of our population has yet to reap the benefits in a significant way: our pets. I myself am a dog owner, and my dog Simba has lived with diabetes for the past two years. The challenges of caring for a diabetic dog are mostly in relation to her insulin dosage, and the stakes are high. I must be extremely precise with her feeding times and amounts so that I can administer the appropriate dosage of insulin, as perscribed by her doctor and adjusted every six months on average. Having her perscription amound adjusted requires her to be under doctor supervision for a 24 hour period during which she repeatedly has blood drawn every hour so that her blood glucose levels can be measured. This process is both traumatic and expensive, and most importantly, it does not capture what the variations in her health on a day-to-day basis. In fact, we have landed in the animal emergency room on more than one occassion because her insulin requirements had changed without me knowing. 1.2 A solution exists One promising solution to this problem comes from advancements in human diabetes treatment: an on-body sensor that can measure blood glucose levels without requiring that a blood sample be drawn1. The sensor is adhered to the upper arm and when a reading device makes contact with the sensor, it outputs current blood glucose levels as well as levels over the previous eight hour period. For a dog or cat, the sensor could be placed at the animal’s neck while the reader is attached to the pet’s collar. This would provide measurements of the animal’s daily blood glucose levels that could be read after each meal and be used to inform how much insulin is required in that moment. However, the technology need not stop there. By combining the blog glucose reader with an activity tracker, I can be sure that I am not only administering the correct amount of insulin based on real time data, but that I am also adjusting the amount of food my dog is given based on her caloric needs that day. Just like with humans, my dog would need to eat less on days when her activity levels are lower, and she would need to eat more on days when we visit the dog park and her activity is above average. By pairing this food recommendation with a real time blood glucose measure, I could be sure that Simba is getting the amount of food she needs and that her insulin is being administered based on that quantity, as well as any other internal factors that would shift her blood glucose level. This would ensure that I could manage her diabetes in the best way possible, using real time data that is reflective of her actual conditions each day. 1.3 Beyond diabetes The described product would greatly add to a pet owner’s ability to manage its diabetes. However, the potential usefulness doesn’t stop there. Our ability to collect and analyze additional useful data on the pets in our lives could greatly add to our ability to care for them. While I have explored how this could change diabetes management, there would appear to be any number of additionally useful data points. According to a survey conducted by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, more than half of the dogs in this country can be classified as overweight or obese2. Activity tracking that is paired with meal portion recommendations could help significantly reduce this number, increasing the health and overall life expectancy of these animals. Non invasive measures of detecting cancers and other life-threatening diseases are continually being immproved3, and it is feasible that this type of technology may in the near future be useful for disease detection in animals as well. Most pet owners want to do what’s best for their animal family members, and for many, a lack of information prevents them from doing so. A pet wellness sensor would help pet owners understand what their pets can’t tell them. The most prohibitive factor to wide spread adoption would of course be cost, but further technological developments promise to drive costs down, and there will always be a segment of the market who will go above and beyond to keep their pets healthy and happy.

["impact-scraper.html", "2 Impact Analyzer 2.1 A beginning. 2.2 A middle. 2.3 An end.", " 2 Impact Analyzer 2.0.0.1 Keywords finance, investing, social media, impact 2.1 A beginning. Within the impact investing industry, there is an assertion from large financial institutions that there is not significant interest to build new investment products. The reason for their hypothesis is based in the asymetric relationship most investors have with their financial advisors: they pay their advisors to know what to do with their money. The problem with this relationship is that many investors don’t feel empowered to ask for what they want, particularly if the request is ill-defined as “impact investing” often is. Additionally, traditionally trained financial advisors often exhibit an initial reaction to tell their clients that impact investing is not a good move for their client’s portfolio - because they’re likely to lose money, or because there aren’t enough options on the market, or simply because the advisor is bad at listening to his client’s requests. The combination of these phenomenon results in an unheard demand reaching the level of financial institutions that can build the investment products. They aren’t truly aware of what people would want to invest in, and so they’re unwilling to take a huge risk to build something new without reasonable assurance that there would be a market for their product. 2.2 A middle. Enter Impact Analyzer. This crawling tool scrapes Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter accounts to collect data on users that fit characteristics of our target demographic. Using LinkedIn, we could generate a database of possible investors who are employed, perhaps within specific geographic regions, and who we determine have some likelihood to invest using proxies such as estimated income. From here, we cross-reference this database with Facebook and Twitter in an effort to identify what social, environmenta, or other issues are important to them. This could be based on organizations they like, news articles they share, people they follow, and other sources. For example, an individual who engages in a significant amount of internal travel content may be interested in investing in products that aid in international development. An individual with strong religious preferences may invest in products that align with the specific tennats of that religion. An individual who often reviews businesses on yelp may be interested in investments in local small businesses in their area. From this analysis we would develop a list of top interests as well as an estimated market size for an impact-focused product. By aggregating this data, an institutional firm could estimate the demand for a new investment product, and would have already gathered a significantly sized initial demographic to target for sales and marketing. 2.3 An end. There are a number of challenges this concept presents. Firstly, of course, the product is only as good as the data that it is able to analyze. If a signficant amount of people’s personal information, likes and dislikes is protected behind inaccessible privacy setting, the output would no longer be entirely represented of the target demographic. Additionally, there are a non insignificant number of estimations that need to be made, including an algorithmically determinining someone’s likelihood to invest, as well as converting the aggregate of those profiles into a market size. And of course, it is unclear if financial institutions, the largest of whom are typically thought of as traditional and less innovative, really would be interested in using this type of information to inform their product building decisions. And even if they would be, there is not yet any indication of how valuable it would be to them. Of course with a working proof of concept and sufficient market testing, these challenges could each be overcome. "]
