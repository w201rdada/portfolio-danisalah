### Pet Wellness Sensor

This innovative product brings advances being made in predictive and personalized healthcare to our pets at home. By applying a sensor to the neck of a dog or cat and a reader to the collar, various health measures can be tracked, with an initial use case for diabetic animals whose blood sugar would be continually recorded and analyzed.

### Impact Analyzer

Using a crawling tool to scrape information from Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, large financial institutions can estimate a market size for impact-focused investment products before the products are built. The web crawling tool will output a database of individuals without a target demographic who are likely to invest (based on age, job titles and salary estimates), and cross reference that with available published interested on social media platforms.
