## A beginning.

Within the impact investing industry, there is an assertion from large financial institutions that there is not significant interest to build new investment products. They aren't feeling the demand because many first time investors haven't considered that investing can help solve large, global problems they care about. If institutions had a better way to measure and capture latent demand, they may understand the impetus in creating new impact focused products.

## A middle.

There should exist a solution with which to catalyze potential investors who may be interested in products that are perfectly aligned with their interests, and to do so in such a way that instutions can measure specific demand to build products based on this demand.

Using a technology similar to IBM Watson's social media analysis, this product would scrape user profiles on social media sites to build a list of likely interests and determine a likelihood for investment in a particular philanthropically-aligned product. An individual who engages in a significant amount of internal travel content may be interested in investing in products that aid in international development. An individual with strong religious preferences may invest in products that align with the specific tennats of that religion. An individual who often reviews businesses on yelp may be interested in investments in local small businesses in their area.

By aggregating this data, an institutional firm could estimate the demand for a new investment product, and would have already gathered a significantly sized initial demographic to target for sales and marketing.

## An end.

Of course, consumers are becoming more aware of and weary of sales attempts based on personal data collected, and anything that feels too "sales-y" may immediately turn off the potential investor. However, if the product offering was targeted enough and did a sufficient job of meeting existing interests, this may be a surmountable challenge.
